# Fetal_health_classification
Objective is to classify the health of the fetus as Normal, Suspect or pathological using CTG data
This repository shows all the plots created during EDA as PDFs as well as a final plot that shows the evaluation metrics of the two models created.
The RandomForest model was the most succesfful with a recall score of .98, precision of .97 and a F1 score of .97
the confusion matrix also shows that the model does a good job of matching each class and does not over predict one class. 
The model would be sufficient at predicting the Fetal Health from the CTG data.
